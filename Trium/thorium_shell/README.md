This contains files for the Thorium Content Shell, a minimal shell similar to WebView on Android (in fact WebView is based on it). \
See > https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_tests_in_content_shell.md

## Usage
Thorium Shell can be used to open a minimal Thorium window. It is also good for Web Tests and Web Development, and can integrate with \
the [test suite in Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_tests.md), as well as use [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) (Puppeteer is unsupported at this time).

Open Thorium Shell by running `thorium-shell` from the command line, or right clicking the Thorium launcher and selecting "Open Thorium Shell" \
For Windows, you can find it in `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Thorium\Application\thorium_shell.exe`. You can make a shortcut to it, and there are icons for it as well as Thorium itself inside this dir if you wanna set icons for it or any other shortcut.

 &ndash; It is useful for making a little browser overlay, for example opening a YouTube video while gaming, or to look something up real quick without opening a full browser window.
