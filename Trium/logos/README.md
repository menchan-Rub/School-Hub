### Synopsis
&nbsp;&nbsp; This contains the iconset and logos for Thorium, Thorium Shell, Thorium UI icons, and Thorium Infrastructure, as well as the Chromium logo, Chromium Infrastructure logo, and other logos such as the GitHub logo used in the Readme.md and various images used in the .md files in this repo.

__IMPORTANT:__ The 'NEW' directory is where the new logos that are used since M100 are from. Use this directory for almost all things.

 - The 'STAGING' dir is for test icons, scratch space, uploading temporary things, icons that don't fit anywhere else, etc.
 - This project also for a small time was called "[Technetium](https://github.com/Alex313031/Technetium)", and I experimented with different logo designs; some are lost, but one of them is in the 'OLD' directory. These extra things are in the 'OLD' directory along with the Thorium logos used since the beginning up until M100.

*LICENSING*: The Chromium Logo is licensed under Chromium's BSD-Style [License](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/CHROMIUM_LICENSE), and some logos like the "bulb" and "build" logos are under Apache's License, which can be found here. The Thorium Logo is licensed under the GPL-3.0 License, however if you are going to use the logo in a derivative project, I would prefer if you let me know first.
