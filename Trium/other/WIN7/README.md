# Thorium for Windows 7/8/8.1 &nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex313031/thorium-win7/main/logos/STAGING/win7/win7_orb.jpg" width="48">

Chromium ended support for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and derivatives like Server 2008 R2, Home Server 2011, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2 starting with Chromium M110 :(

See > https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-and-2012-r2-in-early-2023

This dir used to host build files for Windows 7, and then I made a [branch](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/tree/WIN7), but then I decided to move it all to a whole 'nother repo.

The new repo hosts AVX, AVX2, SSE3, SSE4, and 32 Bit SSE2 & SSE3 builds, kept up to date with the Extended Support branch of Chrome, and with backported patches from newer versions of Thorium.
